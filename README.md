# **DNS and RIP Protocol Project**

This project demonstrates the implementation of the DNS and RIP protocols in a simulated networking environment using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network topology is designed to illustrate how DNS resolves hostnames and how RIP routes packets within a network.

## **Project Overview**

### **Objective:**
To showcase the practical application of DNS and RIP protocols in a computer network using Cisco Packet Tracer.

### **Network Composition:**
- **13 Hosts**
- **5 Routers**
- **4 Switches**
- **2 Servers**

### **Protocols Implemented:**
- **DNS (Domain Name System):**  
  Manages the mapping of domain names to IP addresses, facilitating communication between hosts.
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):**  
  A distance-vector routing protocol used to exchange routing information between routers.

## **Tools Used**

- **Cisco Packet Tracer:**  
  The entire topology is built and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer. This tool allows you to visualize the network, configure devices, and simulate the behavior of DNS and RIP protocols in a controlled environment.

## **Files Included**

- **Project Report (PDF):**  
  The uploaded PDF file contains the full report of this project, detailing the network design, protocol configurations, and test results.
- **Cisco Packet Tracer File (ZIP):**  
  The attached ZIP file includes the Cisco Packet Tracer project file (`.pkt`). You can open this file in Cisco Packet Tracer to explore the network topology and configurations.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites:**
- Ensure you have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your system. You can download it from the [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/).

### **How to View the Project:**
1. **Step 1:** Extract the ZIP file containing the `.pkt` file.
2. **Step 2:** Open the `.pkt` file using Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. **Step 3:** Refer to the PDF report for a detailed explanation of the topology, configurations, and testing results.

## **Usage**

### **Explore the Topology:**
Examine how the 13 hosts, 5 routers, 4 switches, and 2 servers are interconnected.

### **Simulate Protocol Behavior:**
Use Cisco Packet Tracerâ€™s simulation mode to observe DNS resolution and RIP routing updates in action.

### **Learn from the Report:**
The full project report provides in-depth insights into the design decisions, configuration commands, and performance observations.
